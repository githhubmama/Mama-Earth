i have one idea to make transportation easy- by making loop bus which never starts never ends it is circulatary loop or path which when built never has end or begining, only thing i travels rapidly, by this way by reducing one has to wait for busses in cities make me cry, in this revolution we are still waiting for bus is hypocracy
for this we make like transmotor vehicle which has no start no end always travelling, so this way any person any where he can get into bus or leave this is major idea but need as little cocentration.
next gyroscopic selfies, i always admired will i ever take selfies without selfir stick or without help of other or even me. yes by gyroscopic technology we can make any object fly without hesitation, but i think we have not touched the technology still
